# Pacman

This is the Pacman repo where I learned about controlling and manipulating the DOM using javascript. I learned about using if...else statements as well as using operators to control an object. 

How to Run: Go to https://tron-stack.github.io/Pacman-Repo and Click on Pacman.

Future Improvements: finish out the whole game if possible.

Licensing: free to use as you see fit, but beware of Mrs. Pacman and her copyright claims.
